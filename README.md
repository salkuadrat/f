# f 

A simple shortcut, command line interface (CLI) for Flutter to increase productivity and happiness.

## Installation 

Use this command to activate f CLI from your terminal.

```bash 
pub global activate f
```

## Create new project 

Use this f command to create a Flutter project:

```bash 
f c myapp
```

It's similar to using command `flutter create myapp`.

To create a Flutter project with some predefined dependencies, you can list the dependencies after your project name like this:

```bash
f c myapp path intl http provider 
```

The above command will automatically create `myapp` project in the `myapp` directory, then automatically install all the required dependencies (in this example: path, intl, http, and provider).

Feel free to add as many dependencies as you want.

You can also pass other arguments, such as project name, the organization name, or to specify the programming language used for the native platform:

```bash 
f c --p myapp --org dev.flutter --a kotlin --i swift myapp path intl http provider
```

## Run Project 

To run a Flutter project, you can use this command:

```bash 
f r
```

It's similar to using command `flutter run`. 

To run project as `flutter run --profile`, use:

```bash 
f rp
```

To run project as `flutter run --release`, use:

```bash 
f rr
```

You can combine `-v` at the end of each command to show additional diagnostic informations.

```bash
f r -v
```

## Build Project 

To build executable for a Flutter project, you can use this command:

```bash
f b apk
f b arr
f b appbundle
f b bundle 
f b web
```

To build apk with split per abi, use this:

```bash
f bs apk
```
